## Motivation

-   Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body cannot effectively produce or use insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.
    -   422 million people have diabetes worldwide and 1.5 million deaths that occur every year are linked to diabetes [@factsWHO].
-   Machine learning techniques can be used to predict diabetes.
    -   Different studies suggest different techniques to most accurately predict diabetes.
    -   Islam et al.'s study compares 3 different techniques and states that their decision tree produced the most accurate results [-@diabetesStudy]. The study's data is publicly available for analysis.
-   *GOAL*: Reproduce the decision tree in Islam et al.'s study to verify accuracy and compare with a neural network to assess whether this would be more accurate than a tree-based model.

## Data (1 slide)

-   Collected by Islam et al. from a hospital in Bangladesh [-@diabetesStudy] and openly published on Kaggle [@diabetesData].
-   Data contains 17 variables:
    -   Response: Binary variable called class that indicates whether the patient has a positive (1) or negative risk (0) for diabetes
    -   Predictors: 1 quantitative variable (age) + 16 categorical variables describing the patient and if they experience common symptoms related to the disease, such as weakness, itching, and obesity

-   Source?
-   Is it a data frame?
    -   What is in rows?
    -   What is in columns?
-   Results of exploratory analysis?
    -   Data types, type of response if any?
    -   Correlation analysis?
    -   Outliers?
    -   Missingness?
    -   Data transformation, etc. ?
-   $n>p$ or $n<p$ or $n \approx p$?
-   etc. ?

## Data (Example)

```{r}
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: '100%'
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Source: xxx"
knitr::include_graphics("data9.png")
```

$K_{ij}$ abundance of $i$-taxon in $j$-th sample.

## Methods (2 slide)

-   What are the two methods you compared?
-   Why those two methods?
-   Algorithms of the methods?
-   Any statistical transformation used?
-   Any other pre-processing (feature engineering) used?
-   Any feature selection (filter, or wrapper, or embedded) used?
-   etc.?

## Methods (Example)[^1]

[^1]: An introduction to statistical learning [@james2013introduction]

-   KNN and DT for classification.
-   Decision trees - partition the predictor space into simple regions.
    -   Predict $y_{0}$ of a new data point $x_{0}$ using the response of training observations in the region to which $x_{0}$ belongs.
    -   How to find the partitions?
-   KNN -

## Results (1 slide)

-   What are the results of applying the methods?
    -   Visualize the results?
    -   Compare the methods using graphs?
    -   Interpret the model/results?
    -   etc.?

## Discussion (1 slide)

-   Discuss problems related to the methods and data -
    -   Curse of dimensionality?
    -   Multiple data types?
    -   Interpretablity?
    -   Reproducibility?
    -   Stability?
    -   etc. ?
